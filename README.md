## Overview

This repository allows replication of the experiments from the research titled "Adapting Multilingual Embedding Models to Historical Luxembourgish". This repository includes:

- Scripts and notebooks to replicate the training and evaluation of the examined models.
- The training and test data created through articles in Historical Luxembourgish.
- Our reccomended adapted models to be used for semantic search to and from Historical Luxembourgish.

## Repository Organization:

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── RAW_test_set_sentences
│   └── The test set sentences that constitute the bitext mining task, in a jsonl raw unprocessed format.
├── prepared_training_sentences
│   └── The prepared sentences pairs used within the training set. (Also available in HuggingFace datasets format)
├── raw_translations_json
│   └── The original post-corrected translations files before training and test split.
├── HistLuxEmb_Prepare_Data_and_Evaluation.ipynb
│   └── Jupyter notebook to follow through to prepare the data (including utilities) and evaluate existing models.
├── HistLuxEmb_Contrastive_Training.ipynb
│   └── Jupyter notebook to follow through to perform the contrastive training that was appleid to LaBSE, LuxEmbedder and M-GTE.
├── HistLuxEmb_M-Mpnet_Knowledge_Dist.py
│   └── Python script to extend the Multilingual-MPNet model to support Historical and Modern Luxembourgish.
```
